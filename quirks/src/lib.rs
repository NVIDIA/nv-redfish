//! Platform quirks for Redfish BMCs.
//!
//! Real BMCs deviate from the Redfish schema in known ways: a Dell firmware
//! inventory dates every component `00:00:00Z`, an AMI Viking chassis omits
//! the `ChassisType` the schema requires, a BlueField DPU reports an empty
//! `UUID`. This crate is where those facts live, below the generated model
//! and independent of it:
//!
//! - [`BmcQuirks`] classifies an endpoint into a platform class from the
//!   evidence its service root carries ([`RootEvidence`]) and answers which
//!   quirks that class is known for. Classification is a pure function; the
//!   caller decides what it fetches.
//! - The repair table turns the document quirks into rewrites keyed by the
//!   document's `@odata.type` family.
//! - [`UserRules`] holds repairs a caller supplies at runtime, matched by
//!   `@odata.type` family or `@odata.id` pattern and applied after the
//!   platform's. The set can be replaced while the layer is in use.
//! - [`CompatBmc`] is a [`Bmc`](nv_redfish_core::Bmc) over another that
//!   applies both to every document it reads, members a device expanded
//!   inline included. The high-level wrappers in `nv-redfish` read through
//!   it, and a consumer reading generated schema types directly gets the
//!   same repairs.
//!
//! The crate depends on `nv-redfish-core` and `serde_json` only: a repair is
//! a fact about a wire document, and it must not depend on any reading of
//! that document. Quirks that change how a resource is navigated rather
//! than what a document says — a root without links, collection members to
//! ignore, vendor account slots — stay with the wrappers in `nv-redfish`,
//! which consult the same classification.
